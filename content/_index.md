I'm a product manager passionate about building user-centered solutions that solve real problems. With a background in both technology and business, I bridge the gap between technical possibilities and business objectives.

Over the past several years, I've led product development at both startups and established companies, shipping features that millions of users rely on daily. I believe in data-informed decisions, continuous iteration, and always putting the user first.

When I'm not working on products, you can find me writing about product management, mentoring aspiring PMs, or exploring new technologies.
